# Introduction


Working fully browser based was a holy grail for many years. But with the latest release of JupyterLab almost everything you need to do in your creative process with data and code is now possible using only a web browser. 
JupyterLab makes interactive programming possible by using a browser only.

The JupyterLab Notebook is an interactive 'browser based' computing environment that you can use for :

-  Live coding
- Web based interactive coding (full REPL in your browser)
- Interactive widgets
-   Plots
- Create living documents. So creating reproducible scientific documents including:    Equations,     Images, data, graphs ,  video and more has become possible without excuse. If you have a browser, just do it!

JupyterLab is great for exploratory programming and fast experimentation on code and data. When the end goal evolves as new insights come up, the same JupyterLab environment can be used for presenting work which interleaves text and code. So real open research since code, data and result can be inspected and reused. JupyterLab is a great tool to use for [ROI](https://www.bm-support.org/) (Radically Open Innovation)

Jupyter notebooks are already heavily used in data science and related disciplines.  


A JupyterLab notebook has simple options to do very complex things.

Learning all tips and tricks by head is useless if you know where and how to search for solutions.
This short publication helps you finding solution to take your JupyterLab environment to the max.

Notebooks are great. Use it. But if you care about:
* Security & Privacy and
* [Openness](https://www.bm-support.org/open-company-principles/) 
* Real open innovation
Then you should make use of the JupyterLab and other products of the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Project Jupyter is a real FOSS project and supported by institutions worldwide.


JupyterLab will replace the classic Jupyter Notebook in time. So all new developments are concentrated on the JupyterLab environment.

The continues evolution of IPython towards JupyterLab notebooks is a real example of real open innovation.

much as possible.

This publication is created as a living document to collect useful tips for using JupyterLab. 

This is not a "Getting Started" guide, but a collection of tips aimed at users that see the advantage of sharing knowledge and tips to get more productive with JupyterLab.

So this publication is likely to be incomplete. So: I encourage all JupyterLab professional users to help to improve this Guide!

# JupyterLab spin-off projects

Use the JupyterLab eco system to get the max from your JupyterLab project.

This page outlines great FOSS projects that build upon the JupyterLab foundation project.

So do not reinvent the wheel but make the already existing wheels better. If you are aware of a great healthy FOSS project that builds upon the JupyterLab environment just help to make this overview better!
